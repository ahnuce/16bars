#Sixteen Bars
Project 3

Sixteen Bars is a platform for poets, musicians and all other artist who use word as their medium to collaborate and share their work with the world. Creatives will have a way to connect with other artists to collaborate, and expand their work. As their network grows, their content will gain exposure, and they can enjoy the process of publishing their work to 'Books' they create!
